# Smart-Secure-System

This is the code repository for the SWE30011 IoT Programming Assesment 2, which required the development of an IoT Node using an Arduino and Raspberry Pi. This project is a smart surveillance system, which also doubles as a health monitoring system through the tracking of BMI. The circuit setup is included in this repository and the demonstration of the project can be found in the Youtube link as follows: https://youtu.be/4R-BPEw1RCw
